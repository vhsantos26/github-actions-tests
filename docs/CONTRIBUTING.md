# Contributing to uMP

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v18
- Ruby v2.7.7
- Java v17

## We Develop with Github

We use Github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Clone the repository and create your branch from `master` or `develop` depending on your changes.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Report bugs using Jira

We use Jira to track public bugs. Report a bug by creating a new issue in Jira; it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background.
- Steps to reproduce.
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen.
- What actually happens.
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work).

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

We are using [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for TypeScript. The configurations are available in the repository. Run these before committing to ensure your contribution follows our coding style.
